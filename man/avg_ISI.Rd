\title{
Average Intersymbol Inference
}
\description{
Calculates the average intersymbol inference for two sets of matrices.
}
\usage{
avg_ISI(W, A)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{W}{
Array of unmixing matrices with dimension \code{[P, P, D]}.
}
  \item{A}{
Array of true mixing matrices with dimension \code{[P, P, D]}.
}
}
\details{
The function returns the average intersymbol inference for the set of estimated unmixing matrices and the set of true mixing matrices. The average ISI gets the value between 0 and 1, where 0 is the optimal result. The average ISI is calculated as the mean ISI over each dataset separately. The average ISI does not take the permutation of the estimated sources into account.
}
\value{
Numeric value between 0 and 1, where 0 is the optimal result indicating that the sources are separated perfectly in each dataset.
