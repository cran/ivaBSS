\title{
JBSS Achieved
}
\description{
The function calculates if the joint blind source separation (JBSS) is achieved.
}
\usage{
jbss_achieved(W, A)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{W}{
Array of unmixing matrices with dimension \code{[P, P, D]}.
}
  \item{A}{
Array of true mixing matrices with dimension \code{[P, P, D]}.
}
}
\details{
The function calculates if the joint blind source separation is achieved. JBSS is considered achieved when the the location of maximum absolute values of each row of gain matrix
\code{G[,,d] = W[,,d] \%*\% A[,,d]} is unique within the dataset, but shared between the datasets \code{1, ...,D}. The first indicates that the sources are separated within dataset and the second indicates that the estimated sources are aligned in same order for each dataset.
}
\value{
Logical. If \code{TRUE} the JBSS is considered achieved.
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
