Description: Independent vector analysis (IVA) is a blind source separation (BSS) model where several datasets are jointly unmixed. This package provides several methods for the unmixing together with some performance measures. For details, see Anderson et al. (2011) <doi:10.1109/TSP.2011.2181836> and Lee et al. (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.sigpro.2007.01.010>.
